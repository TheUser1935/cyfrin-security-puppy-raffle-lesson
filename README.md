# Cyfrin's Security and Auditing course - Puppy Raffle Lesson

The purpose of this repo is to contain 2 main aspects relevant to this lesson and audit:
1. Files and notes around the process of conducting the security review/audit, as well as the types of vulnerabilities.
2. The code that is subject to the review/audit as part of this lesson

## Notes.md

This file is where I capture the learnings during the course. It is not designed to capture specific audit/review info but rather the general security lessons. This notebook will become part of my general web3 learning respository.

## audit-data

This folder contains templates that will be used to generate reporting, notes we take during the audit, as well as the final report for the audit

## img

This folder will hold any images that are references in the Notes.md file.

## Foundry Framework

I utilise the Foundry framework across all my projects. It is utilised in this project too.

Refer to the [Foundry book](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for further information about its capabilities and usage.
